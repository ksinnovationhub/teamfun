<h4 class="title-left">Indemnification</h4>

<p>Our Indemnification Obligations: we agree to indemnify, defend, and hold you harmless,&nbsp; including any of your subsidiaries, employees, and shareholders, from and against any claims brought by Third Parties arising from or relating to our violation of a Third Party&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Rights directly arising out of your use of the Service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,we shall have no indemnification obligation with respect to any claims (i) arising out of or related to your Data (ii) to your violation of any applicable laws; (iii) your violation, whether alleged or actual, of any Third Party rights, including but not limited to data protection and privacy rights.</p>
<p>Your Indemnification Obligations: you shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Agorapulse, including any of its subsidiaries, employees, and shareholders (&ldquo;Agorapulse Indemnified Parties&rdquo;), to the maximum extent permitted, in full and in perpetuity, and at your own cost, from any third party liabilities, claims, costs, expenses, obligations, losses or damages, excluding indirect damages and consequential loss that may arise from (i) your unauthorised use of any material obtained through the Site and Service; (ii) your use and access to the Site and Service which is not in accordance with this Agreement; and (iv) your violation, whether alleged or actual, of any Third Party rights.</p>
<p>Indemnification Procedures: The parties&rsquo; respective indemnification obligations above are conditioned on: (a) the indemnified parties giving the indemnifying party prompt written notice of the claim, except that the failure to provide prompt notice will only limit the indemnification obligations to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced by the delay or failure; (b) the indemnifying party has full and complete control over the defense and settlement of the claim; (c) the relevant indemnified parties providing assistance in connection with the defense and settlement of the claim (as long as the settlement does not include any payment of any amounts by or any admissions of liability, whether civil or criminal, on the part of any of the indemnified parties), as the indemnifying party may reasonably request; and (d) the indemnified parties&rsquo; compliance with any settlement or court order made in connection with the claim. The indemnifying party will indemnify the indemnified parties against: (i) all damages, costs, and attorneys&rsquo; fees finally awarded against any of them with respect to any claim; (ii) all out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with the defense of the claim (other than attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs incurred without the indemnifying party&rsquo;s consent after it has accepted defense of such claim); and (iii) all amounts that the indemnifying party agreed to pay to any third party in settlement of any claims arising under this Clause and settled by the indemnifying party or with its approval.</p>
<p>Infringement Remedy: If you are enjoined or otherwise prohibited from using any of the Service or a portion thereof based on a Third Party Intellectual Property infringement claim covered by our indemnification obligations under this Clause above, then we will, at our sole expense and option, either: (a) obtain for you the right to use the allegedly infringing portions of the Service; (b) modify the allegedly infringing portions of the Service so as to render them non-infringing without substantially diminishing or impairing their functionality; or (c) replace the allegedly infringing portions of the Service with non-infringing items of substantially similar functionality. If we determine that the foregoing remedies are not commercially reasonable, then we will promptly provide a prorated refund to you for any prepaid fees received by us under this Agreement that correspond to the unused portion of the Term. The remedy set out in this Clause is your sole and exclusive remedy for any actual or alleged infringement by us of any Third Party Intellectual Property Rights in the event that you are enjoined or otherwise prohibited from using any of the Service or a portion thereof based on a claim covered by our indemnification obligations under this Clause.</p>
<p>You shall be solely responsible with respect to defending any such claims, and for the payment of losses, costs, damages or expenses resulting from the foregoing to both a Third Party and to Agorapulse in connection therewith. You shall not, without the prior express written approval of Agorapulse, attempt to, or settle, dispose or enter into any proposed settlement or resolution of any claim (whether having been finally adjudicated or otherwise) brought against You, if such settlement or resolution results in any obligation or liability for Agorapulse. Provided that this clause shall survive termination of this Agreement, however occurred, and termination of your access and/or use of the Site or Service.</p>
